/**
 * Two-pass walker over a list of `NamedExtractor`s. One source of
 * truth for the resolution algorithm — called by both
 * `extract-from-run.ts` (outer Pipeline) and `CLAUDE_ENVELOPE` (inner
 * string recovery). Eliminates the duplicated candidate-building +
 * two-pass loop that previously lived inline in `CLAUDE_ENVELOPE`
 * (sage#63 round-4 Maintainability finding).
 *
 * Resolution semantics:
 *
 *   - Pass 1: walk extractors in order; if one produces a value that
 *     matches `preferredShape`, return it.
 *   - Pass 2: walk extractors in order again; return the first
 *     defined value (`preferredShape` ignored).
 *   - Memoize Pass-1 outputs so Pass 2 replays from memo without
 *     re-invoking expensive scans (fenced regex, balanced walks,
 *     trailing walks, JSON.parse).
 *
 * `ExtractionAttempt`s are returned for the per-extractor Pass-1
 * outcome — the outer Pipeline uses them for error-message context;
 * the inner CLAUDE_ENVELOPE caller ignores them.
 *
 * `preferredShape` is REQUIRED. The Module does not carry a default
 * predicate — Lens-shape is a caller-side concern owned by consuming
 * Modules (sage#73 — refines sage#57). Callers without a shape
 * preference pass `() => false` to fall through to Pass-2
 * "any-parseable wins."
